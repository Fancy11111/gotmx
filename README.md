# GoTMX

This is an experiment using go, [fiber](https://docs.gofiber.io/), [templ](https://templ.guide/) and[htmx](https://htmx.org/).

## Additional dependencies
- [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [sqlc](https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/tutorials/getting-started-sqlite.html) for queries
- [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for a better development experience

## Future ideas
- [cobra](https://cobra.dev/) for flags
- i18n, not quite sure which tool to use yet though
